# Recipe Lab Audit Backlog (2026-07-27)

Verified findings from a code audit. Each item has file:line anchors.
Work top to bottom within a severity band. Check items off as they are fixed and verified.

## How dedup currently works (context for the dedup fixes)

Dedup is a prompt-time similarity search against local IndexedDB only, and only for the
first chat message of a session (`useRecipeChat.ts:73-88`):

- New recipes: `searchRecipes()` (`db/recipes.ts:115-144`) lowercases the prompt, splits on
  whitespace, drops words of length <= 2, scores each local recipe by the fraction of query
  words appearing as substrings in `title + description + tags + ingredient names`.
  Threshold >= 0.5, top 5 shown with a "Create Anyway" bypass.
- Variations: `searchVariations()` (`db/recipes.ts:146-171`) same scoring algorithm within
  the local tree, threshold >= 0.4, top 3, but a different haystack: `title + description +
  prompt + tags`, with ingredient names swapped for the originating prompt.
- Handles case and word order. Does not handle: plurals/stemming, substring false positives
  ("rice" matches "licorice"), all-short-word prompts (returns nothing), semantics.
- There is NO dedup at save time, on data import, on later chat messages, or against
  Firestore, so duplicates flow freely into the shared cloud library.

## High severity

- [x] **INFRA-1** `npm run lint` fails with 11 pre-existing errors + 10 warnings
      (unused vars in `firestore.ts`/`AuthContext.tsx`/hooks, react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
      warnings). The lint gate must be green for /preflight and /audit-next to work.
      Caution: the exhaustive-deps warnings overlap with real stale-closure bugs in this
      backlog (FUN-9, FUN-14); fix deps deliberately, never by blindly adding suppressions.
      (fixed: 0 errors, exit 0. no-unused-vars now ignores rest siblings/underscore args;
      useAuth co-location gets a targeted disable; useNotifications markAllRead deps fixed
      via uid destructure; set-state-in-effect demoted to warn since the per-hook rewrites
      belong to FUN-8/9/11/13 + UI-12. 17 warnings remain, deferred to those findings.)
- [x] **SEC-1** Deploy Firestore security rules (repo now has `firestore.rules` +
      `firestore.indexes.json`; project is still in test mode). `firebase deploy --only firestore`
      (fixed: deployed 2026-07-27 to recipe-lab-3832b — rules compiled + released, indexes
      deployed. Verified target against `.firebaserc` and confirmed the released rules are
      the ownership-enforcing ruleset, not test mode. UID-migration limitation still stands.)
- [x] **FUN-1** Dedup never checks Firestore, so users publish duplicates to the shared
      library. Cloud recipes are not mirrored locally, so `searchRecipes` cannot see them.
      (`useRecipeChat.ts:76-78`, `db/recipes.ts:125`)
      (fixed: scoring extracted to `lib/search.ts`; new `searchPublishedRecipes` scores the
      cloud feed and merges with local matches, local winning on id ties. Two of the five
      panel slots are reserved for cloud matches so local results can't bury the cloud
      duplicate. Cloud failure degrades to local-only. Also fixed a regression this
      introduced: dedup is now a network call, so `sendMessage` got an in-flight ref guard
      and covers the search with `isLoading` — without it a second send skipped dedup and
      raced a second Gemini generation. Labels distinguish own-but-not-on-this-device from
      another user's recipe.
      NOT fixed, deliberately: dedup still only sees the newest 200 published recipes and
      re-reads that feed per prompt with no caching — a real limit, needs a server-side
      index to fix properly. A failed cloud check is also silent to the user; folded into
      UI-12. Reaching a cloud-only recipe shows no lineage (FUN-11) and can surface a
      recipe whose cloud delete was orphaned (FUN-3).)
- [x] **FUN-2** `saveRecipe` has no in-flight guard and the Save button never disables;
      double-tap creates two recipes with different UUIDs in both stores.
      (`useRecipeChat.ts:101-129`, `RecipeCardMessage.tsx:61-62`)
      (fixed: `savingRef` guard plus an `isSaving` state the hook exposes; RecipeCardMessage
      takes `saving` and renders a disabled "Saving…" button. Both halves are needed — the
      button is still enabled in the same synchronous tick as the first click, before React
      re-renders, so the ref is what actually stops tap 2. Stays locked after success since
      the page navigates away; unlocks and surfaces `error` on failure.
      Verified in-browser with a stubbed Gemini response: three rapid taps wrote exactly one
      recipe. No unit test — the guard lives in a React hook and the Vitest env is node with
      no jsdom or React testing setup.)
- [x] **FUN-3** Deleting a recipe cascades locally but deletes only the single doc in
      Firestore, orphaning published variations reachable via `/shared/:id` and profiles.
      (`RecipeDetailPage.tsx:56-64` vs `db/recipes.ts:71-95`, `firestore.ts:80-83`)
      (fixed: subtree computation extracted to `collectSubtreeIds` in `lib/tree.ts` and
      shared by both cascades, so local and cloud delete exactly the same set.
      `deleteRecipeTree` now returns the ids it deleted; new `deletePublishedRecipeTree`
      queries the cloud tree by rootId — catching variations published from another device
      that were never local — and deletes each doc individually via `allSettled`, not a
      `writeBatch`, because one rules-denied descendant would abort an atomic batch and
      leave the whole subtree published. Removed the now-unused single-doc
      `deletePublishedRecipe` so the old footgun can't be picked up again.
      NOT fixed: descendants owned by OTHER users are denied by the rules and stay
      published — same Cloud Function gap as the UID migration. The cascade result is still
      swallowed, so a partial failure is invisible; that belongs with FUN-5/UI-12.)
- [ ] **FUN-4** Ownership fallback (`!user` or `createdBy.uid === 'local'`) shows Delete on
      other people's cloud recipes; rules now block the write server-side but the UI still
      offers it and it previously succeeded. (`RecipeDetailPage.tsx:34-37`)
- [ ] **UI-1** SharedRecipePage renders `null` while loading and forever on fetch failure:
      blank white page for share-link recipients on any error, no spinner or retry.
      (`SharedRecipePage.tsx:136`, `:42-56`)
- [ ] **UI-2** Anonymous-account warning banner uses `warning-*`/`success-*` color tokens
      that are not defined in `index.css`, so the app's only data-loss safeguard prompt
      renders mostly invisible. (`ProfilePage.tsx:48-70`, `index.css:3-31`)
- [ ] **UI-3** Version tree current/root nodes hardcode light `bg-primary-50` with themed
      text: illegible in dark mode. Same pattern in `RecipeDetailPage.tsx:249` and
      NotificationBell unread rows. (`VersionTreePage.tsx:65-67`)
- [ ] **UI-4** Back navigation from the chat silently discards an unsaved generated recipe;
      no guard, no persistence, no confirm. (`RecipeChatPage.tsx:55-58`)
- [ ] **UI-5** Missing Gemini API key is discovered only after composing and sending a
      message; error is plain text with no link to Settings, and raw Gemini exception text
      is shown verbatim. (`useRecipeChat.ts:26-30`, `:55-57`, `RecipeChatPage.tsx:176-180`)

## Medium severity

- [ ] **FUN-5** Firestore publish is fire-and-forget with swallowed errors and no retry;
      Share still emits a cloud URL that 404s for recipients. Needs a reconciliation or
      retry path, and Share should verify the recipe is actually published.
      (`useRecipeChat.ts:123-124`, `share.ts:42-44`)
- [ ] **FUN-6** Settings import does `bulkPut` with no dedup and no schema validation:
      re-import duplicates every recipe under new UUIDs; malformed records later crash
      `searchRecipes`. (`SettingsPage.tsx:44-61`, `db/recipes.ts:103-105`)
- [ ] **FUN-7** Approved collaborators are written only to the Firestore doc, but the owner
      UI prefers the local Dexie copy, so owners never see collaborators on their own
      device. (`firestore.ts:228-230`, `useRecipe.ts:48`)
- [ ] **FUN-8** After a recipe is deleted, `removeCloudFavorite`'s batch update on the
      missing doc rejects, so the cloud favorite can never be removed.
      (`firestore.ts:136-145`, `useFavorites.ts:50`)
- [ ] **FUN-9** Favorite toggle read-then-write race: double-tap runs `increment(1)` twice,
      permanently inflating `favoriteCount`. (`useFavorites.ts:39-67`, `:82-105`)
- [ ] **FUN-10** `publishRecipe` uses unconditional `setDoc` that resets `favoriteCount`
      and `viewCount` to 0 on any re-publish. Latent until a retry mechanism exists.
      (`firestore.ts:27-35`)
- [ ] **FUN-11** Version tree and variation dedup read local Dexie only: empty tree and
      zero dup detection when varying someone else's cloud recipe.
      (`useRecipeTree.ts:5-11`, `db/recipes.ts:55-57`)
- [ ] **UI-6** "Suggest a Change" exists only on `/shared/:id`; non-owners browsing the
      shared feed land on `/recipe/:id` which has no suggest affordance, making the
      headline collaboration feature undiscoverable. (`SharedRecipePage.tsx:245-251`)
- [ ] **UI-7** Recipe detail back button always goes to `parentId` or `/` with
      `replace: true`, ignoring real history (tree, profile, notifications) and corrupting
      the hardware back button. (`RecipeDetailPage.tsx:39-45`)
- [ ] **UI-8** Notification dropdown (`w-80`, right-anchored) clips offscreen on 320-390px
      viewports. (`NotificationBell.tsx`)
- [ ] **UI-9** RecipeCard nests a `span role="link"` with onClick inside a `<button>`:
      creator link is unreachable by keyboard and broken for screen readers.
      (`RecipeCard.tsx`)
- [ ] **UI-10** Touch targets below 44px: TopBar icon row (32px), suggestion Approve/Reject
      text buttons (~24px). (`RecipeDetailPage.tsx:117-169`, `:270-281`)
- [ ] **UI-11** Version tree costs 48px per depth level in a non-scrolling column; deep
      chains leave <150px for cards on a phone. (`VersionTreePage.tsx:90`)
- [ ] **UI-12** Cloud failures render as happy empty states: Firestore offline shows
      "No recipes yet" and "Recipe not found" instead of an error with retry.
      (`useRecipeLibrary.ts`, `useRecipe.ts`, `LibraryPage.tsx:190-195`)

## Low severity

- [ ] **FUN-12** `incrementRecipeViews` in useEffect under StrictMode double-counts every
      view in dev. (`RecipeDetailPage.tsx:76-81`, `main.tsx:7`)
- [ ] **FUN-13** Cloud fallback gated on an arbitrary 100ms setTimeout instead of awaiting
      the Dexie query. (`useRecipe.ts:24-45`)
- [ ] **FUN-14** "Create New Anyway" has no in-flight guard; double-click runs two
      concurrent Gemini generations. (`useRecipeChat.ts:95-99`)
- [ ] **FUN-15** A failed first message (e.g. no API key) consumes the one-shot dedup
      check; dedup is permanently skipped for the rest of that chat session.
      (`useRecipeChat.ts:64-93`)
- [ ] **UI-13** Inconsistent feedback patterns: native `alert()` in Settings import, three
      different empty-state styles, ad hoc Button reimplementations on ProfilePage.
      (`SettingsPage.tsx:55-57`, `ProfilePage.tsx:308-318`, `:408-413`)
- [ ] **UI-14** Modal/dropdown a11y gaps: dialogs missing `aria-labelledby`, bell missing
      `aria-expanded` and unread count announcement, unlabeled search input, ChatInput
      autofocus fights AuthModal focus. (`AuthModal.tsx`, `NotificationBell.tsx`,
      `LibraryPage.tsx:78-84`, `ChatInput.tsx`)

## Known limitation introduced by the security rules

Client-side UID migration (`AuthContext.tsx:59`, `firestore.ts:423-519`) rewrites docs
belonging to the OLD uid while authenticated as the NEW uid. Rules cannot verify the old
identity, so these writes are now denied. The call is fire-and-forget so nothing crashes,
but cloud data will not migrate when an email sign-in lands on a different uid. Proper fix:
a Cloud Function using the Admin SDK, or linking credentials so the uid never changes.
Local Dexie migration is unaffected.
